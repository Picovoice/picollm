## Accuracy

picoLLM Compression is a novel large language model (LLM) quantization algorithm developed within Picovoice. Given a task-specific cost function, picoLLM Compression automatically learns the optimal bit allocation strategy across and within LLM's weights. Existing techniques require a fixed bit allocation scheme, which is subpar.

For example, picoLLM Compression recovers MMLU score degradation of widely adopted GPTQ by 91%, 99%, and 100% at 2, 3,
and 4-bit settings. The figure below depicts the MMLU comparison between picoLLM and GPTQ for Llama-3-8b [[1]](https://picovoice.ai/blog/picollm-towards-optimal-llm-quantization/).

## AccessKey

AccessKey is your authentication and authorization token for deploying Picovoice SDKs, including picoLLM. Anyone who is
using Picovoice needs to have a valid AccessKey. You must keep your AccessKey secret. You would need internet
connectivity to validate your AccessKey with Picovoice license servers even though the LLM inference is running 100%
offline and completely free for open-weight models. Everyone who signs up for
[Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) receives a unique AccessKey.

## Demos

Install the demo package:

```console
pip3 install picollmdemo
```

Run the following in the terminal:

```console
picollm_demo_completion --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --model_path ${MODEL_PATH} --prompt ${PROMPT}
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console, `${MODEL_PATH}` with the path to a model file
downloaded from Picovoice Console, and `${PROMPT}` with a prompt string.

For more information about Python demos go to [demo/python](demo/python/README.md).

## SDKs

### Python SDK

Install the Python SDK:

```console
pip3 install picollm
```

Create an instance of the engine and generate a prompt completion:

```python
import picollm

pllm = picollm.create(
    access_key='${ACCESS_KEY}',
    model_path='${MODEL_PATH}')

res = pllm.generate('${PROMPT}')
print(res.completion)
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console, `${MODEL_PATH}` to the path to a model file
downloaded from Picovoice Console, and `${PROMPT}` to a prompt string. Finally, when done be sure to explicitly release
the resources using `pllm.release()`.

### Node.js SDK

Install the Node.js SDK:

```console
yarn add @picovoice/picollm-node
```

Create instances of the picoLLM class:

```javascript
const { PicoLLM } = require("@picovoice/picollm-node");
const pllm = new PicoLLM('${ACCESS_KEY}', '${MODEL_PATH}');

const res = await pllm.generate('${PROMPT}');
console.log(res.completion);
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console, `${MODEL_PATH}` to the path to a model file
downloaded from Picovoice Console, and `${PROMPT}` to a prompt string. Finally, when done be sure to explicitly release
the resources using `pllm.release()`.

### Android SDK

Create an instance of the inference engine and generate a prompt completion:

```java
import ai.picovoice.picollm.*;

try {
    PicoLLM picollm = new PicoLLM.Builder()
        .setAccessKey("${ACCESS_KEY}")
        .setModelPath("${MODEL_PATH}")
        .build();
    PicoLLMCompletion res = picollm.generate(
        "${PROMPT}",
        new PicoLLMGenerateParams.Builder().build());
} catch (PicoLLMException e) { }
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with your `AccessKey` from Picovoice Console, `${MODEL_PATH}` to the path to a model file
downloaded from Picovoice Console, and `${PROMPT}` to a prompt string. Finally, when done be sure to explicitly release
the resources using `picollm.delete()`.

### iOS SDK

Create an instance of the engine and generate a prompt completion:

```swift
import PicoLLM

let pllm = try PicoLLM(
    accessKey: "${ACCESS_KEY}",
    modelPath: "${MODEL_PATH}")

let res = pllm.generate(prompt: "${PROMPT}")
print(res.completion)
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console, `${MODEL_PATH}` to the path to a model file
downloaded from Picovoice Console, and `${PROMPT}` to a prompt string.

### Web SDK

Install the web SDK using yarn:

```console
yarn add @picovoice/picollm-web
```

or using npm:

```console
npm install --save @picovoice/picollm-web
```

Create an instance of the engine using `PicoLLMWorker` and transcribe an audio file:

```typescript
import { PicoLLMWorker } from "@picovoice/picollm-web";

const picoLLMModel = {
  modelFile: '${MODEL_FILE}'
}

const picoLLM = await PicoLLMWorker.create(
  "${ACCESS_KEY}",
  picoLLMModel
);

const res = await picoLLM.generate(`${PROMPT}`);
console.log(res.completion);
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/), `${MODEL_FILE}` with the contents of the model file as `File`, `Blob` or `URL (path to model file)` format and `${PROMPT}` with a prompt string. Finally, when done release the resources using `picoLLM.release()`.

### C SDK

Create an instance of the engine and generate a prompt completion:

```c
pv_picollm_t *pllm = NULL;
pv_picollm_init(
    "${ACCESS_KEY}",
    "${MODEL_PATH}",
    "best",
    &pllm);

pv_picollm_usage_t usage;
pv_picollm_endpoint_t endpoint;
int32_t num_completion_tokens;
pv_picollm_completion_token_t *completion_tokens;
char *output;
pv_picollm_generate(
    pllm,
    "${PROMPT}",
    -1,    // completion_token_limit
    NULL,  // stop_phrases
    0,     // num_stop_phrases
    -1,    // seed
    0.f,   // presence_penalty
    0.f,   // frequency_penalty
    0.f,   // temperature
    1.f,   // top_p
    0,     // num_top_choices
    NULL,  // stream_callback
    NULL,  // stream_callback_context
    &usage,
    &endpoint,
    &completion_tokens,
    &num_completion_tokens,
    &output);
printf("%s\n", output);
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console, `${MODEL_PATH}` to the path to a model file
downloaded from Picovoice Console, and `${PROMPT}` to a prompt string.

Finally, when done, be sure to release the resources explicitly:

```c
pv_picollm_delete(pllm);
```
