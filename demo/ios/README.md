## picoLLM Inference Engine

picoLLM Inference Engine is a highly accurate and cross-platform SDK optimized for running compressed large language

- Cross-Platform
- Runs on CPU and GPU
- Free for open-weight models

## Compatibility

- Swift 5
- iOS 16.0+

## AccessKey

AccessKey is your authentication and authorization token for deploying Picovoice SDKs, including picoLLM.
You must keep your AccessKey secret. You will need internet connectivity to validate your AccessKey with
Picovoice license servers even though the LLM inference is running 100% offline and completely free for
open-weight models. Everyone who signs up for [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) receives a unique AccessKey.

## Setup

Download your desired model file from the [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/). If you do not download the file directly from your iOS device, you will need to upload it to the device to use it with the demos. To upload the model, use AirDrop or connect your iOS device to your computer via USB or launch a simulator. Copy your model file to the device.

## Usage

There are two demos available: completion and chat. The completion demo accepts a prompt and a set of optional
parameters and generates a single completion. It can run all models, whether instruction-tuned or not. The chat demo can
run instruction-tuned (chat) models such as `llama-3-8b-instruct`, `phi2`, etc. The chat demo enables a back-and-forth
conversation with the LLM, similar to ChatGPT.

### Completion Demo

1. Go to the [Completion](Completion) directory. Then run:

```console
pod install
```

2. Open the `PicoLLMCompletionDemo.xcworkspace` in XCode

3. Replace `let ACCESS_KEY = "${YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE}"` in the file [VieModel.swift](./Completion/PicoLLMCompletionDemo/ViewModel.swift) with your AccessKey obtained from [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/).

4. Build and run the project on your device.

5. Press the `Load Model` button and load the model file from your device's storage.

6. Enter a prompt that you want a completion for, e.g. "roses are red".

7. Experiment with the optional parameters by pressing the menu button on the top left.

### Chat Demo

1. Go to the [Chat](Chat) directory. Then run:

```console
pod install
```

2. Open the `PicoLLMChatDemo.xcworkspace` in XCode

3. Replace `let ACCESS_KEY = "${YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE}"` in the file [VieModel.swift](./Chat/PicoLLMChatDemo/ViewModel.swift) with your AccessKey obtained from [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/).

4. Build and run the project on your device.

5. Press the `Load Model` button and load the model file from your device's storage.

6. Chat back and forth with the LLM using the text box at the bottom.

7. Use the clear button in the lower right hand of the text box to reset the chat and start a new one.
